In bot history, the tokens you see are old and outdated. You can try using them but they will not work

# Running the bot
I would rather you invite my bot to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=756257170521063444&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647) because you will need to set up mongodb for for the database. If you know how to do that then follow below

Otherwise, Here is how you can run your own version of avimetry. If you do run or use the source code, You must open source your bot too, according to the licence.

**Requirements: You can find them in requirements.txt**

**Hosting the Bot**
1. Make a `.env` file in the `avimetrybot` folder. Add your database token (I used MongoDB) and your bot token there. Please follow the format below.
```
Bot_Token="put your discord bot token here"

DB_Token="put your mongodb token here"

Zane_Token="put your zaneapi token here"
```

2. Run the bot on your computer or online. I will not be helping you with that. You're on your own there. 

3. Success!
