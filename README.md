# Running the bot
I would rather you invite my bot to your server with this [link].(https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=756257170521063444&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647)

Otherwise, Here is how you can run your own version of avimetry. If you do run or use the source code, You must open source your bot too, according to the licence.
**Requirements: You can find them in requirements.txt**

**Hosting the Bot**
1. Make a `.env` file in the `avimetrybot` folder. Add your database token (I used MongoDB) and your bot token there. Please follow the format below.
```
Bot_Token="put your discord bot token here"

DB_Token="put your mongodb token here"
```
2. Run the bot on your computer or online. I will not be helping you with that. You're on your own there. 

3. Success!
